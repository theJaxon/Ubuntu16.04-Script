# Ubuntu16.04-Script
[![Bash Shell](https://badges.frapsoft.com/bash/v1/bash.png?v=103)](https://github.com/ellerbrock/open-source-badges/)

After setting up the Ubuntu OS, update the system, place this script in your home directory ~ and then run it.

#### Prupose:
I made this script since i was tired of having to add repos and search with synaptic for every single app i want so i collected all the programs i install , all the indicators and themes in this script.

Also there used to be more files in the Templates folder but i forgot which ones were there so this script creates 3 files in the Templates folder just to make things a bit easier.
